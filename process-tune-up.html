                Looked at how things were actually getting done (not how they were supposed to),

    <section class="py-16 px-4 bg-gray-50">
        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">Overview</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The operations team was frustrated with slow processing times, but the official 
                    process documentation didn't match reality. They needed someone to figure out 
                    what was actually happening and find the bottlenecks.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 mt-8">Solution</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    I analyzed the actual workflow by tracking time spent at each stage and identifying 
                    where delays were occurring. The data revealed several bottlenecks that weren't in 
                    the official process docs—manual handoffs, redundant approvals, and data entry errors 
                    that required rework.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 mt-8">Results</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Processing time dropped by 40% after implementing the recommended changes. The team 
                    was thrilled because the improvements were practical and didn't require major system 
                    overhauls—just smarter workflows based on what was actually happening.
