                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    A client had a critical decision to make and needed data analysis fast. They were 
                    considering a major investment but didn't have the insights to know if it was the 
                    right move. Time was running out.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 mt-8">Solution</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Instead of proposing a month-long analysis, I built a focused analysis tool in a day 
                    that answered their specific questions. I pulled the relevant data, created clear 
                    visualizations, and delivered actionable insights they could use immediately.

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-600 space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li>Rapid data extraction and cleaning</li>
                    <li>Focused analysis on key decision factors</li>
                    <li>Clear visualizations showing risks and opportunities</li>
                    <li>Immediate recommendations based on findings</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 mt-8">Results</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    The client got the answers they needed in time to make an informed decision. The analysis 
                    revealed that the investment wasn't the right move at that moment, saving them from 
                    a costly mistake. They appreciated the speed and clarity of the insights.
