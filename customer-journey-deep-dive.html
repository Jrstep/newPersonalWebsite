                Traced where customers were getting lost (spoiler: it was step 3). Found the 
                drop-off points and suggested fixes that didn't require a complete rebuild.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The marketing team knew customers were dropping off somewhere in their journey, but 
                    couldn't pinpoint exactly where or why. They needed a clear picture of the customer 
                    experience to identify improvement opportunities.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 mt-8">Solution</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    I mapped the entire customer journey using data from multiple touchpoints, creating 
                    visualizations that showed exactly where customers were getting stuck. The analysis 
                    revealed that step 3 in their onboarding process had a 40% drop-off rate.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 mt-8">Results</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    The team implemented targeted fixes at the identified drop-off points, focusing on 
                    step 3 first. The changes were simple—better messaging and clearer instructions—but 
                    they didn't require a complete rebuild. Conversion rates improved significantly 
                    within weeks.
